  Applicaiton

  Openshift (you have to learn once you are in project)
  - it will have fixed steps (first time have recording & follow it next time)

  Node + express (Backedn -- you will not do anything here) API's

  React (learning) (Front End - your code will be here)
  
  SSO - there is a website, you have to login 
    - multiple ways
    - username password
    - MFA - multi factor authentiation (captcha, otp , popup notification on mobile)
    - 3rd party service ( google / linkendg/ twitter)
    - SSO (Okta, one login, azure)
        - some one will do the configuration & everythign will be completed
        - you need to understand the architecture of SSO login
        - start picking up these tasks once you are familiar with your project
